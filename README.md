## Overview

LeetSensei is a browser extension designed to enhance the LeetCode experience by providing pseudocode hints and explanations for problems.

- **Explanations**: Detailed explanations are available for each problem, making it easier for users to grasp the underlying concepts.

- **Enhanced Learning**: Users can learn the problem-solving process step by step, which is crucial for improving their algorithm and data structure skills.

## Why LeetSensei?

LeetSensei addresses a common issue faced by LeetCode users. When seeking help or searching for a problem's solution, they often find the answer right away, missing out on the learning experience. While LeetCode offers a "Solutions" tab, it primarily focuses on providing answers, without offering pseudocode hints or explanations.

LeetSensei was created to provide a solution that encourages users to learn, grow, and understand the problem-solving process, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their coding skills and tackle LeetCode problems effectively.
